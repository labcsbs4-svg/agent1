Time-Off & Work-From-Home Policies
Paid Vacation Leave

Full-time employees at Creative Solutions Inc. receive 20 paid vacation days per calendar year. We believe time away from work is essential for staying creative, productive, and mentally refreshed. Vacation days can be used for personal travel, family time, rest, or simply stepping away to recharge.

To ensure smooth team operations, we recommend submitting vacation requests at least two weeks in advance. For extended trips or time off longer than five consecutive working days, employees should coordinate early with their managers. Our goal is always to balance personal time with project needs, and we strive to approve requests whenever possible.

Unused vacation days do not roll over into the next year unless approved by HR under special circumstances. Employees are encouraged to use their time off and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy

We support flexible working arrangements and recognize that remote work can boost productivity and job satisfaction. Employees may work from home up to 3 days per week, pending manager approval. The remaining days are in-office to support team collaboration, client discussions, and cross-functional work.

When working remotely, employees are expected to:

Maintain reliable internet connectivity

Be available during normal working hours

Attend virtual meetings on time

Maintain a distraction-free and professional environment

Follow all company data-security and confidentiality guidelines

Managers may adjust WFH schedules based on project deadlines, team needs, or client requirements. Flexibility works both ways — we trust our team to balance independence with responsibility.

Public Holidays & Additional Leave

In addition to vacation days, employees receive all standard public holidays, plus access to:

Sick leave

Emergency leave

Parental leave (based on eligibility)

Bereavement leave

We aim to create a supportive environment where employees have the time and space they need for both personal and professional responsibilities.
